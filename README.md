## Compare by running Playwright and Cypress

This repo contains a vite app, you can compare both playwright and cypress tests by running the following scripts and evaluating the time differences: `npm run test:playwright` and `npm run test:cypress`. You can clearly see some difference in the time taken to run both the tests, even with only test suite to be run. With multiple tests running in parallel, playwright will have an upper hand with speed and performance.
